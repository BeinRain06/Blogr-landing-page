## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox



### What I learned

While working on this project, i learn how to blend image background using css property `background-image`:

```css
 #home{

  background-image: linear-gradient(10deg, var(--very-light-red), var(--light-red));

}

.infrastructure .container1{

  background-image: radial-gradient(circle closest-corner at 38%, var(--dark-desatured-blue), var(--dark-blue));
  
}
```

With `background-image` rear color enhance lighting effects at some area which make the background looks pretty much in live. 

*menu design*

``` The project also give me opportunity to fly into my menu design knowledge. As i built hamburger itself and choosing animation playing along before it content is shown.```

*responsiveness*

```I worked as well onto multiple width fit screen for responsiveness. I looked large rate of sizing just than making eat for mobile width screen of * 375px * expecting on this project. I choosed too |920px, |840px, |720px, |600px ```

*log in and sign up disposition*
``` i changed the disposition of the link login and sign up in the media query with a  width of |375px. Hope that is looking pretty well ```

*footer links hover*
``` i styled some hover for footer , that could make user experience feel comfortable when crossing through links of the footer ```



### Continued development
This project tease me to tackle others from the same board to be comfortable when using svg files images because i struggled on it, and to improve my accuracy for steadiness and view rightness of each section contains in all these projects.
I need also to see how to make landscape responsiveness mobile screen


### Feeling
This projects was a good one to begin with, like a Junior. You may think static design like this one isn't difficult for implementation. But once inside the project you discover that evry section doesn't fit the same and you need to look into what could be done , minding through your challenge and glancing for some proper solutions and helps to get through a style  which feed onto your imagination.
